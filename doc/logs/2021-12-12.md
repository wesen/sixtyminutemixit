## Create new supabase app

I am following the [supabase nextjs tutorial](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/with-nextjs).
I set up a database connection in intellij by finding the DB url under Settings -> DB.

Created the nextjs skeleton

```shell
npx create-next-app app 
cd app
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

Aside: why npm or yarn? Apparently there's a yarn 2 that people don't like. 
Anyway, doesn't seem to be any reason for now to not use npm.

I am also installing prettier and eslint:

```shell
npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier
npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier
npm install eslint --save-dev
npx eslint --init
cd ..
echo {} > .prettierrc.json 
```

I am adding tailwindcss to the mix, and I will try my own hand at styling whatever the tutorial app
or the mashup I make up.

```shell
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
```

I'm not exactly sure about the standard tailwindcss steps, so I am following the [nextjs version](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs)

```shell
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

```

I also installed the tailwind css jetbrains extension.

The cool thing is that there is tailwindui ($279 though), and open source designs (tailwindcomonents.com).
I'm gonna mash my way through with tailwindcomponents for now.

I copied the [instagram component](https://tailwindcomponents.com/component/instagram-login-page) and it's actually not too bad.
Not entirely sold on the whole tailwind approach, but I haven't learned enough yet.

### First feature building: facebook signup

First, setup facebook signup / login in the supabase settings, and create an app and credentials in facebook.
